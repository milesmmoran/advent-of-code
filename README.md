# Algo Names
first-pass - the code that I had when the test cases first passed;

concise - the algo I came up with that has the fewest lines of code;

performant - the algo I came up with that has the best performance;

preference - the algo I came up with that I prefer (generally on the basis of maintainability);


# Scripts
`npm run dev` - runs the code within the dev/index.ts folder. Good for testing out code snippets before finalizing the problem.
`npm run cli` - runs a CLI that lets you run historical data

# CLI Structure
years > days > parts > algos (whatever naming convention you want)
